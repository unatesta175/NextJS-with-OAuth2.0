## üë®‚Äçüíª About This Project

### üéØ The Full-Stack Transformation Journey

This Next.js frontend represents the **culmination of an intense 2-month learning journey** during my semester break (August 8th to September 30th, 2024) between my **4th and 5th semester** at **UiTM Jasin**. It's part of a complete architectural transformation from a monolithic Laravel application to a **modern full-stack system** with separated concerns.

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è CONTEXT:** This is the frontend portion of the **Lunara Spa Full-Stack System**, paired with a Laravel API backend. The **Lunara Spa logo and brand** were **created by me (Muhammad Ilyas Bin Amran)** as original work.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER:** This project is developed **for educational and learning purposes only**, specifically for my **Final Year Project (FYP)**. This is a portfolio project to demonstrate modern full-stack development skills with React and Next.js, and is not intended for commercial use.

## üìñ My React & Next.js Learning Story

### üéì The Big Decision (Before Semester Break)

As my 4th semester wrapped up, I had this crazy ambition - rebuild my entire Laravel spa booking system (which I'd already rebuilt from PHP) into something even more modern for my **FYP project**. But this time, I wanted to go full-stack with a proper frontend framework. The question was: **which framework?**

### ü§î Vue vs React vs Angular? (Early August 2024)

At first, **Vue.js** seemed like the obvious choice. Everyone I talked to said the same thing: *"Vue is the easiest to learn!"*, *"It's more beginner-friendly than React!"*, *"Angular is way too complex, avoid it!"* 

But then I started thinking differently. Sure, Vue might be easier to learn initially, but what about in the long run? I did my research:

**React** has:
- The **biggest community** and ecosystem
- The **most job opportunities** in Malaysia and globally  
- **Flexibility** - you can build it however you want
- **Massive library ecosystem** - there's a package for everything
- It's used by Facebook, Netflix, Airbnb, and tons of major companies

So I made my decision: I'm going with **React**, even if it's harder. Better to invest time learning something that'll be more valuable in the long run, right?

### üì∫ The BroCode Crash Course (August 8-9, 2024)

I found this absolute gem on YouTube - **[BroCode's React Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgkZ7MvWUAA)**. It's a comprehensive 12-hour tutorial covering everything from basics to advanced React concepts.

And here's the crazy part - **I finished the entire course in 2 days**. 

**Day 1 (August 8):**
- Woke up at 9 AM, grabbed breakfast
- Started the course at 10 AM
- Coded along with every single example
- Took short breaks for meals
- By midnight, I was 6 hours in
- Finally crashed at 2 AM

**Day 2 (August 9):**
- Started again at 10 AM
- Finished the remaining 6 hours
- Rewatched confusing parts
- Practiced building small components on my own
- By 10 PM, I felt like I finally "understood" React

The concepts I grasped:
- **Components & JSX** - Building blocks of React
- **Props** - Passing data between components
- **State Management** - Using `useState`
- **Event Handling** - onClick, onChange, etc.
- **Conditional Rendering** - Showing/hiding components
- **Lists & Keys** - Rendering arrays of data
- **Forms** - Handling user input
- **useEffect Hook** - Side effects and lifecycle

By the end of day 2, I was thinking in components. I could visualize how to break down a UI into reusable pieces. React's component-based architecture just *clicked*.

### ‚ö° Discovering Next.js (Mid-August 2024)

Just when I thought I had my tech stack figured out, someone mentioned **Next.js** in a Discord server I was lurking in. They said:

*"Why use plain React when Next.js gives you all of this out of the box?"*
- **File-based routing** - No React Router configuration needed!
- **Server-side rendering** - Better SEO and performance
- **Built-in API routes** - Can create backend endpoints in the same project!
- **Image optimization** - Automatic image optimization
- **Fast refresh** - Lightning-fast development experience
- **TypeScript support** - First-class TypeScript integration

I looked into it and thought, *"If I'm building something for my FYP, why not use the best tools available?"*

So I started learning Next.js. The learning curve wasn't that steep since I already knew React. The main new concepts were:
- App Router vs Pages Router (I went with App Router)
- Server Components vs Client Components
- File-based routing with folders
- Loading and error boundaries
- Layouts and templates

Within a week, I was comfortable with Next.js and decided: **This is what I'm using for my project!**

### üìö The Never-Ending YouTube Binge (August - September 2024)

And then... the real learning began. Over the next month and a half, I basically lived on YouTube. My browser history was just:
- "React hooks tutorial"
- "Redux Toolkit crash course"
- "useContext vs Redux"
- "React Hook Form tutorial"
- "How to handle forms in React"
- "Zod validation React"
- "TanStack Query tutorial"
- "Axios vs Fetch"
- "TypeScript with React"

**What I Had to Learn:**

**React Hooks Deep Dive:**
- **useState** - Managing local component state (understanding closures and why state doesn't update immediately was a journey!)
- **useEffect** - Side effects, dependency arrays (I spent hours debugging infinite loops because I didn't understand dependencies properly)
- **useContext** - Context API for avoiding prop drilling (made my life so much easier!)
- **useMemo & useCallback** - Performance optimization (learned when NOT to use them too)
- **Custom Hooks** - Creating reusable stateful logic

**State Management - Redux Toolkit:**

This was probably the **hardest concept** to grasp. I watched at least 10 different Redux tutorials before it finally clicked.

The Redux concepts I struggled with:
- **Store** - Global state container
- **Slices** - Reducers + actions combined
- **Actions & Reducers** - How state actually updates
- **Selectors** - Reading from the store
- **Thunks** - Async operations

But once I understood the pattern, Redux became my go-to for managing complex state. The DevTools are amazing for debugging!

**Form Handling:**
- **React Hook Form** - Performance-focused form library
- **Zod** - Schema validation (TypeScript-first!)
- Form validation patterns
- Error handling in forms

**Data Fetching:**
- **Axios** - HTTP client (I chose this over Fetch because it reduces boilerplate)
- **TanStack Query** - Server state management

About TanStack Query... I actually learned it and thought it looked amazing with its automatic caching, background refetching, and optimistic updates. But honestly, when I started building my project, I found that **Axios + Redux** was working fine for my use case, so I didn't end up using TanStack Query. Maybe in my next project!

**TypeScript:**
- Types and Interfaces
- Generics
- Type inference
- Utility types

**Styling:**
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS (no more writing CSS files!)
- **shadcn/ui** - Beautiful pre-built components
- Responsive design patterns

### üî• The Day-to-Night Coding Marathon (August - September 2024)

Calling it a "semester break" would be a lie. It was more like an **intense 2-month self-imposed full-stack bootcamp**. 

My typical day:
- Wake up around 10 AM (if I slept)
- Coffee + breakfast while watching a tutorial
- Start coding by 11 AM
- Code straight through lunch
- Brief dinner break
- Code more
- "Just one more feature" at 11 PM
- Suddenly it's 2 AM
- "Let me just fix this bug"
- Look at the clock: **6 AM**
- Finally crash from exhaustion
- Repeat

My parents were worried. My friends thought I'd gone crazy. But I was in this incredible flow state where I was learning so much every single day. Every bug I fixed taught me something new about React's rendering cycle, or Redux's state updates, or how async/await really works.

### üí™ Learning Laravel as Pure API (The Backend Journey)

This project also required me to learn **Laravel in a completely different way** than I had before. Previously, I used Laravel with Blade templates - a traditional server-rendered approach.

Now I had to learn:
- **RESTful API design** - Proper HTTP status codes, REST conventions
- **Laravel API Resources** - Formatting JSON responses properly
- **Stateless authentication** - JWT tokens, OAuth 2.0
- **CORS configuration** - Making frontend and backend talk to each other
- **API middleware** - Authorization, rate limiting
- **Sanctum vs Passport** - I went with Passport for OAuth 2.0

No more Blade templates. No more server-side sessions. Everything had to be **pure JSON responses** and **token-based authentication**.

### üò§ The 6-Day Laravel Passport Battle (Late August 2024)

If I'm completely honest, setting up **Laravel Passport (OAuth 2.0)** was the **most frustrating** part of this entire project. It took me **almost 6 days** to get it working correctly!

The challenges:
- OAuth 2.0 concepts were abstract and confusing
- **HTTP-only cookies** with CORS - Why won't the cookies be sent?!
- **Token refresh logic** - When does the access token expire?
- **Passport client setup** - Which grant type do I use?
- **Cookie settings** - secure, httpOnly, sameSite - getting all of these right
- **CORS preflight requests** - OPTIONS requests failing

I probably spent 3 of those days just on the **cookie-based authentication** part. The tokens would work with localStorage, but I wanted the security of HTTP-only cookies. Getting the browser to actually send those cookies in cross-origin requests... man, that was a battle.

By the end of those 6 days, I had read the Laravel Passport documentation probably 15 times, watched every Passport tutorial on YouTube, and had about 50 Stack Overflow tabs open.

But when it finally worked? When I saw the cookies being sent correctly and the authentication flow working smoothly? Best feeling ever.

### üåê The Never-Ending CORS Nightmare

Speaking of frustrations... **CORS issues**. The bane of every full-stack developer's existence.

`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` errors. `CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials'` errors. Preflight requests failing. Cookies not being sent.

The backend was running on `localhost:8000`. The frontend on `localhost:3000`. They refused to talk to each other nicely.

I had to learn about:
- **CORS headers** - Access-Control-Allow-Origin, -Methods, -Headers, -Credentials
- **Preflight requests** - OPTIONS requests before actual requests
- **withCredentials** - Enabling cookies in Axios
- **Laravel CORS package** - Configuration in `config/cors.php`

It took countless hours of tweaking configurations, clearing caches, and testing in different browsers before everything worked smoothly.

### üéØ Why Axios Over Fetch?

One decision I'm really proud of: choosing **Axios over the native Fetch API**. While Fetch is built into JavaScript, Axios just makes life so much easier:

**Axios advantages:**
- Automatic JSON transformation (no more `response.json()`)
- Better error handling (actually throws on error status codes)
- **Interceptors** - Perfect for adding auth tokens to every request
- Request/response transformation
- Timeout configuration
- Cancel requests easily
- Better browser support

The interceptors feature alone made it worth it. I could add the authentication logic once and have it apply to all API calls. Beautiful!

### üéâ The Finish Line (Late September 2024)

And then, amazingly, in **late September** - right before my **5th semester started** - I finished it!

The full-stack system was complete:
- ‚úÖ Laravel API backend with Passport authentication
- ‚úÖ Next.js frontend with modern React patterns
- ‚úÖ Redux Toolkit for state management
- ‚úÖ Complete booking system with calendar
- ‚úÖ Payment integration (ToyyibPay)
- ‚úÖ Admin dashboard with analytics
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control
- ‚úÖ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- ‚úÖ Type-safe with TypeScript

I had done it. **Solo**. I built a production-quality full-stack application using technologies I learned from scratch in just 2 months.



### üéì The FYP Head Start

The best part about finishing this before semester 5? **This project IS my FYP project!**

While my classmates are just starting to plan their final year projects, I've already built mine. All those sleepless nights, all the CORS frustrations, all the Redux confusion - it was all worth it because I'm already way ahead.

And more importantly, **I can confidently say: I know how to create a full-stack system for real now**. Not just following a tutorial, but actually architecting, building, and deploying a complete application. Solo.

## üé® Key Components

### Authentication Flow

```typescript
// Redux slice for auth state management
const authSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'auth',
  initialState: { user: null, isAuthenticated: false },
  reducers: {
    login: (state, action) => { /* ... */ },
    logout: (state) => { /* ... */ }
  }
})
```

### API Integration

```typescript
// Axios instance with interceptors
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL,
  withCredentials: true, // Send cookies
})

api.interceptors.request.use(/* Auth token */)
```

### Form Validation

```typescript
// Zod schema validation
const bookingSchema = z.object({
  service_id: z.number(),
  therapist_id: z.number(),
  appointment_date: z.string(),
  appointment_time: z.string(),
})
```

```

### Issue: Environment variables not working

**Solution:** Restart the dev server after changing `.env.local`:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Images not loading

**Solution:** Check that the image paths are correct and the backend storage is linked:
```bash
cd backend
php artisan storage:link
```

### Issue: Authentication not persisting

**Solution:** Ensure cookies are being sent with `withCredentials: true` in Axios config.
